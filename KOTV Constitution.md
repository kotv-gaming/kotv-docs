# Constitution

## Membership

Membership in the **Keepers of the Void** gaming community is accorded upon joining our in-game outfit, clan, or guild in a game (for example, PlanetSide 2) and actively participating in the community.

**Members** have certain rights and duties:

Duties:

* Be respectful and show good sportsmanship
* No racism, except against the French
* Do not violate a game's EULA
* Follow **Community Policies**

Rights:

* Bear the **KOTV** tag in-game
* Apply to the **Staff** and have a say in **Community Policies**
* Bring any grievance to the **Staff**

## Staff

**Staff** can be nominated by **Members** during a Community Meeting or chosen by **Staff** at any time.

Staff have the same rights and duties as **Members**, along with:

Duties:

* Moderate the Discord
* Manage promotions and demotions in-game and on Discord
* Decide on Community Policies by vote or consensus
* Getting members' feedback for the **Staff** during meetings

Rights:

* Approve kicking out members if their actions violate the constitution or their duties

To apply as **Staff**, a Member needs to have been active within the community for at least three months.

This position has a one-month trial period, after which the **Staff** will decide to confirm by a majority vote.

Community Policies only become valid if a majority of Staff approve.

## Community Meeting

Community Meetings are held at least once every three months to elect a **Community Leader** and a **Force Commander**.

Sessions are only valid if announced to all **Members** at least five days in advance.

A Community Meeting can be held in exceptional circumstances if voted upon by **Staff**.

Only **Members** can attend and vote in a Community Meeting.

Candidates for elected positions will give an overview of their previous contributions and gaming experience, lay out their plan on how they will contribute to the outfit and why they are qualified. Participants will then elect each position by majority vote.

The vote for a **Community Leader** will take place before any other vote, if applicable.

## Elections

Once every three months, **Members** elect the **Community Leader** and a **Force Commander** during a **Community Meeting**.

Voting isn't necessary if there's only one candidate.

The **Community Leader** has the same rights and duties as **Staff**, along with:

Duties:

* Chair Staff and Community Meetings
* Lead diplomacy between other gaming communities
* Lead the outfit and pass it on to future generations

## Right to Contest

To call for an early re-election, demote, or kick out an active **Community Leader** or **Force Commander**, a Community Meeting must be held.

A two-thirds majority vote in the Community Meeting is needed to succeed.

Any **Staff** member can be removed by other **Staff** by a majority vote, or during a Community Meeting of all **Members** by a two-thirds majority vote.

## Amendments

The constitution can be amended by a two-thirds majority vote in a Community Meeting.
